My work through [Structure and Interpretations of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) by Gerald Jay Sussman and Hal Abelson.

I work with [Gambit Scheme](http://gambitscheme.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) here.

Gambit Scheme can be installed via Homebrew with `brew install gambit-scheme` on Mac OSX.
